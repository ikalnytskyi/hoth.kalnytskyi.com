This repository contains Ansible playbook to deploy a VM for personal use which
includes but not limited to self hosting various services.

## Services

### [Vaultwarden]

Alternative implementation of the Bitwarden server API written in Rust and
compatible with upstream [Bitwarden clients], perfect for self-hosted
deployment where running the official resource-heavy service might not be
ideal.
